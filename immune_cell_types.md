### CD4 Memory subtypes
Th1 = Tbet+ (TBX21) ~1% of CD4 memory
Th2 = GATA3+ ~0.2-0.6% of CD4 memory
Th17 = RORgT+ ~2% of CD4 memory
Tregs = FOXP3+ 
TTregs = IKZF1+ (Helios); Thymic T-regs

### CD8 Memory subtypes
Tbet+ ~25%
GATA3+ ~5%
Tc17 RORgT+ ~10%

## B cells

Naive, CD27-, IgD+
Pre-switch, CD27+, IgD+
Post-switch, CD37+, IgD-

Mystery cells: CD19+, CD27-, IgD- (~3%)

Nebulous: IgD+IgM+
IgM distribution (low to high) within the Naives
- Variable between people

Post-switch IgA vs IgG (usually not double-positive)
Some are also Ig-

Plasmablasts, CD20-, CD38+
- Subset to IgM, IgD, IgA, IgD

Transitional B cells IgD+CD10+ ~13% of Naives
- Also some CD27+CD10+ cells, but not well understood ~3%
Exhausted B cells CD38-CD21- ~3%
Activated B cells CD20+CD71+ ~1.5%

## T cells

TEMRA Tregs: not really a type, an artifact of gating
TEMRA: CD45RA+CD197- (very low CD4, more in CD8)
Naive: CD45RA+CCR7+
CM: CD45RA-CCR7+ (More in CD4, Less in CD8)
EM: CD45RA-CCR7-

cTfh: Circulating Tfh, CD185+CD279+ (CXCR5+PD-1+)
Activated Tfh: within cTfh with CD278+CD38+ (CD278 = ICOS)
Tph: Within CXCR5-PD1+ with CD278+CD38+

Non-naives: KLRG1+TIGIT+ population that Adam's interested in.

ILCs: HLA-DR- with CD127+
