L153-L157: Not clear how this conclusion is reached based on the benchmarks presented. In Figure 1c, it looks like APEC performs similarly to Cusanovich 2018, while SnapATAC has higher Entropy and ARI.

Fig. 1: Difficult to see that TooManyPeaks has very low ARI. May want to add an arrow or other callout to indicate that TooManyPeaks was benchmarked, but had a value of (or close to) zero.
